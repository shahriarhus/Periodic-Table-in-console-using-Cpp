# Periodic Table in console using Cpp
 Periodic table using console C++ with ability to search and learn details of elements
 ---
## ABSTRACT
This program is a non-GUI, console program dedicated for students in chemistry field. This
program will help students to get the details regarding each element which is available within the
periodic table. This periodic table consists of 118 elements that will enable the students to get the
details of each element by just entering the atomic no. of the elements. The information
generated related to elements are Atomic weight, Melting point, Boiling point, Heat capacity,
Electro-negativity, Quantity on Earth. Also, it displays the periodic table itself first in the
program where student can refer the group number. Identify the common periodic trends that can
be deduced from the periodic table of elements.
---
To become familiar with the periodic table and how the atomic properties of the elements are
related to their position on the periodic table. It describes what each of the following is and how
each varies within the periods & groups of the periodic table.
The source code for _Periodic Table project in C++_ is simple and understandable, which
consists of around 100 lines of code. The code should be compiled in _Code::Blocks_
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) in which the project was developed by using
GCC compiler
